# FMRHUB.COM FRONT END
This repo is part of my personal projects, ultimately it will serve as front end to fmrhub.com, a domain that I have acquired to work on several goals, from home network management to trying on new stuff, and eventually help on opensource projects.

The goal is to create a page to manage several services that will be hosted in the cloud AWS and possibly localhost, making it a hybrid project. 

## Architecture
The project will use React JS as front end. 

Semantic-ui will be used as the main development framework.

## Notes
Here I will create notes on how react works in case I don't touch it often.

* Semantic UI is implemented by using a CDN, the implementation is in public/index

* Installed react-router-dom
> npm install react-router-dom
